The solution involves ensuring Tailwind is correctly configured within your framework's build process. This typically includes:

1. **Correctly importing and configuring Tailwind:**  Make sure you've followed Tailwind's instructions for setting up the plugin (if using PostCSS), and that the `tailwind.config.js` file is properly configured and points to the correct CSS file.
2. **Checking your framework's build process:** Ensure Tailwind's CSS is processed during your build.  This often involves configuring a build plugin or loader for Tailwind (e.g., the `postcss-loader` in Webpack or appropriate plugins for Vite).
3. **Validating class names:** Double-check that you're using valid Tailwind CSS class names; typos are a common cause of such errors. 
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve the issue by removing old cached files.

Example (Vue.js with Vite):

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

```javascript
// main.js (or equivalent entry point)
import './style.css'
import App from './App.vue'
import { createApp } from 'vue'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

```javascript
//App.vue
<template>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    Hello, world!
  </div>
</template>
```
