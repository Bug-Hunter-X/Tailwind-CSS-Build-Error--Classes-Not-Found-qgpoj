This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.js that uses a build process. The error typically looks like `Failed to compile` or similar and points to an issue where Tailwind can't find the necessary CSS classes during the build process.  This can happen if the Tailwind configuration isn't set up correctly or if there is an issue with how your framework integrates Tailwind.
