# Tailwind CSS Build Error: Classes Not Found

This repository demonstrates a common issue when integrating Tailwind CSS with JavaScript frameworks like Vue or React: build errors caused by Tailwind not recognizing or finding the necessary CSS classes.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of code that triggers the error, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The root cause is often misconfiguration of Tailwind's postcss setup or incorrect import/usage in the framework's build process.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies (adjust package manager as needed): `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the build command (check your framework's documentation for the correct command).  Observe the error in the `bug` example and the successful build in the `bugSolution` example.
